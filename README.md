#Map Reduce

Please run the test.sh bash script in visual studio or a terminal.
The test.sh script will run the run.py program with three different UDFs and config files.

The intermediate and output files for each test case will be located in their respective folder. e.g. wordCount intermediate 
and output files will be in test/wordCount/intermediates folder.
